Chapter 1

You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible.

I'm Gotham's reckoning. It'll end the ball of damns you've all been living on. A necessary evil.

You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.

Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.


Chapter 2
